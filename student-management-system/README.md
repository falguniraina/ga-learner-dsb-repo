### Project Overview

 A student management system (also known as a student information system or SIS) helps a school manage data, communications, and scheduling.


A school system generates and uses a large amount of data. This data must be communicated appropriately to students, faculty, and parents. A student management system helps schools to store, manage, and distribute this information.


Some student management systems are designed to serve all of a schoolâ€™s data management needs. Other student management systems are specialized. These specialized solutions target specific needs, such as school applications or student behavior tracking.

Pricing Information
Pricing for student management systems varies greatly depending on the size and needs of the school. Additionally, student management system vendors rarely release pricing information. Speak to a vendor to get a detailed estimate for your needs.


Some vendors offer per-student pricing. This pricing model may be per month or per year. Per-month prices may range from under $2.00 per student to over $10.00 per student. Per-year prices may exceed $20.00 per student.


Other vendors offer monthly subscriptions to their software without a per-student fee. Depending on the capabilities of the software, prices may range from under $10.00 per month to over $1,000.00 per month.
